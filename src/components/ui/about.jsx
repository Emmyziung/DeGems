                The journey of De Gems Exclusive Club of Iperu-Remo began with a simple yet powerful idea: to create a social platform that would reconnect old friends, foster meaningful relationships, and promote personal and communal growth. This idea was initially conceived and reviewed by two dedicated and like-minded individuals, and soon gained momentum as more like-minded individuals bought into the vision.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In June 2018, a WhatsApp platform was created to bring everyone together, and the name De Gems Exclusive Club of Iperu was officially adopted. This virtual gathering eventually led to the club's inaugural physical meeting, which took place on December 26, 2018, at the Solomon Gbadebo Compound, Ogere Road, Iperu-Remo, Ogun State.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The club started with over 20 members. Although some members left due to personal reasons, the group solidified its foundation with 18 committed individuals by January 2020. Since then, De Gems has continued to grow stronger in unity and purpose.
